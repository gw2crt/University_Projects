Adam,

The website is hosted at http://www.fakenewsnetwork.gw2crt.co.uk

The search bar is hidden behind the burger menu and has keywords
which you need to accept and then click enter again to perform the
search.

There is a link to add a story which is there to demonstrate it can be done, however
there isnt a security session on this so it would be removed from a real life site.


The site is fully respopnsive down to 320px and has been tested in firefox, chrome and edge.
the contact page stores the details in a database which can be dealt with at a later date.

The Modal contains an miniture avatar which when hovered over gives you the name of the author.
The social media links in the storys link to the social media, one prints the story out and one will email the story using whatever the default
email a link to the site with the headline using the a default email application.

The stories are placed randomly so they change positions giving the user the impression of new stories.
